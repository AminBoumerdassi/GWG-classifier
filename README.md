# GWG-classifier
A convolutional neural network for classifying gravitational-wave glitches from gravitational-wave detectors such as LIGO, Virgo or KAGRA.

## Things to do:
1. Rework label creation into an understandable format
2. Redo one-hot encoding of labels with inbuilt Keras functions
3. Integrate downsampler into the main CNN
